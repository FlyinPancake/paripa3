				### Why do we need to reconstruct the configuration?

				- To run software designed for a specific device in a virtual machine
				- To test this software in an isolated environment
				Note:
				Kell a kernel konfigurációja, hogy tudjuk modositani hogy elmenjen Qemuval.

				---

				### End goal of the project

				To be able to reconstruct the configuration of the Linux kernel from a kernel binary
				with the least amount of user input possible.

				<!-- Spoiler Alert .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
				---
				### Constraints (for now)

				- The kernel must be built from a source code that's publicly available on the internet.
				- We do not use kernel modules.
				- We generally do not care about numeric (integer or hex) options.
				- Our main focus is on the ARM and MIPS architectures since these are common in IoT settings.

					## Previous Work

					---

					### [kconfig_rs](https://github.com/FlyinPancake/kconfig_rs)

					- Rust library for parsing Kconfig files
					- Can be used to enumerate and query the configuration options

					---

					### Smaller projects

					- sourcehunter: finds the `#ifdef` guarded source blocks, and extracts them
					- stringhunter: finds the strings in the source code blocks and extracts them
					- ink-checker: config generator that uses the extracted strings and a kernel binary
					 to make an educated guess about the configuration

			## Starting Point
			- The goal was to use the string literals in the source code to act as indicators for the configuration options.
			- The approach should not be considered a failure, but the implementation was lacking crucial features.
			- The approach from the previous semester was unable to yield desirable results

			---

			### Problems with the previous approach
			- The static analyzer ignored that files can be conditionally compiled
			- `#if defined(CONFIG_FOO)` style conditionals were ignored
			- Dependencies defined in Kconfig files were ignored


			---
			## Ideas for potential improvements

			---

			### Improvement idea #1

			1. Make a static analyzer that can output expressions for a line of code to be compiled into the kernel (e.g.: `CONFIG_FOO && CONFIG_BAR`)
			2. Run this static analyzer for every unique string in the kernel source code.
			3. That yields a set of expressions for every string in the kernel source code. 
			---

			<!-- ### Improvement idea (cont.)

			4. There are powerful tools for solving boolean satisfiability problems (SAT)
			5. We can use these tools to find a configuration that satisfies all the expressions for a string
			6. We can then use this configuration to compile the kernel and check if the string exists in the compiled kernel

			--- -->

			### Possible problems

			- The configuration space is too large to be solved by any SAT solver
			- The SAT solver is too slow to solve the problem
			- There are too many configurations that might satisfy the expressions
			- Any error in the static analyzer will lead to a wrong configuration 
			
			---
			### Improvement idea #2
			Use `gcc`'s preprocessor instead of my own preprocessing step

			This seems pretty obvious, however I don't believe this is the best approach.
			`gcc` needs a config and it can provide a preprocessed source code.
			We need to find the config that produces a desired preprocessed source code.

				## Processing the preprocessor output

				We use the Kbuild system to generate the preprocessed source code and check if a string exists.

				---

				### String locking vs Config locking approach 

				Note:
				Up until this point we only looked at string locking approaches.
				There are also config locking approaches.
				We can imagine these like mazes where we have to find a path from the start to the end.
				There is a popular maze solving method to go from the end to the start.
				This is what we do in the config locking approach.

				---
				### Getting the preprocessed source code

				- `gcc -E` is used to run the compiler up to the preprocessor stage
				- However we use the Kbuild in the context of Linux
				- The Kbuild system has an `*.i` target that generates the preprocessed source code


				---

				### Getting the preprocessed source code

				- Every C source file in the kernel has a corresponding `*.i` target
				- If the source file would not be compiled into the kernel, the `*.i` target is not generated
				- Otherwise the `*.i` file contians the preprocessed source code

				---
				### Using the preprocessed source code

				---

				### Problems with this approach

				- The number of unique configuration options is simply too large (there are over 10000 options)
				- We can make guesses comparing strings from our tested configurations with strings from the known configurations
				- We need to find a way to reduce the number of configurations to test

				### Mini-Projects During the Semester

				Throughout the semester I worked on smaller projects to help with the main project.

				---

				### Creating a preprocessed kernel source files

				We need a reliable way to generate the preprocessed source code for the files in the kernel source code.

				--------------------------------------------
				```bash
				gcc -E source.c -o source.i
				```
				Works for a single file, but not for the whole kernel
				
				Adding `-E` to the `CFLAGS` in the Makefile breaks the build system,
				and no `*.i` files are generated since we had not specified the `*.i` targets.

				---
				```bash
				make /path/to/kernel/source.i
				```
				Works, but:
				- It is slow
				- It is not script friendly

				Note:
				- doesnt always create the .i files
				- -j flag doesnt work
				- slower than compiling the kernel (due to the many I/O operations) 

				---
				### Researched the Kbuild system

				- Kbuild is the build system used by the Linux kernel
				- It consists of a set of Makefiles and Kconfig files

				---
				### Front end for the string literal extractor `hardcodes`

				## Conclusion

				---

				### What I learned

				- How to use and modify the Kbuild system
				- More about the Linux kernel architecture
				- Writing efficient parsers

				---
				#### Don't make a graph of everything

				---
				### Viability of the project

				- There are partial solutions for this problem (see [bn_kconfig_recover](https://zznop.com/2022/01/02/automated-re-of-kernel-build-configs/))
				- The current string-locking approach yields poor results
				and this is due to the fact that my preprocessor output is not remotely accurate
